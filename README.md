## Projects

### 1. Predictive Analytics for Housing Prices

**Description:** This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities.

**Key Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas

**Highlights:**
- **Data Analysis:** Performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
- **Modeling:** Built and evaluated multiple regression models with RMSE as the performance metric.
- **Visualization:** Created scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to visualize relationships.

### 2. Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

**Description:** Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on purchasing behavior for targeted marketing strategies.

**Key Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Highlights:**
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed customer data and applied scaling techniques.
- **Modeling:** Implemented K-Means clustering and visualized clusters.
- **Visualization:** Generated cluster plots and silhouette scores.
